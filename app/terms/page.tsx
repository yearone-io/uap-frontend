        interactions, personal finance management, and on-chain gaming
        automation.

      <h2>4. Modifications & Upgrades</h2>
      <p>
        UAP is designed to be modular and upgradeable. We may introduce
        modifications, updates, or enhancements that affect how assistants
        operate. Users are responsible for ensuring continued compliance with
        updated protocols.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data & Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        UAP does not directly store personal data but interacts with
        decentralized protocols where data privacy is managed on-chain. Users
        are responsible for their own privacy and security, including
        safeguarding private keys and access credentials.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Third-Party Assistants & Integrations</h2>
      <p>
        UAP allows third-party developers to create and integrate new
        assistants. We do not endorse, control, or assume liability for
        third-party assistants. Users engage with these at their own risk and
        must conduct due diligence before integration.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        UAP is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, either express
        or implied. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation of
        UAP. We are not liable for any losses, damages, or liabilities arising
        from your use of UAP, including but not limited to loss of funds, smart
        contract vulnerabilities, or incorrect automation outputs.
      </p>

      <h2>8. No Liability for Bugs or Malfunctions</h2>
      <p>
        We do not accept any responsibility for any bugs, malfunctions, or
        errors in the UAP protocol or virtual assistants. Users acknowledge that
        Web3 technologies and automation tools may be subject to unforeseen
        issues. We disclaim any liability for financial losses, missed
        transactions, or operational failures resulting from bugs or security
        vulnerabilities.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold harmless UAP’s developers, contributors,
        and affiliates from any claims, damages, or expenses resulting from your
        use of UAP or violation of these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to UAP if you
        violate these Terms or engage in any harmful activity. Termination does
        not affect rights and obligations accrued before the termination date.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Changes to the Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of UAP after
